    description: `I'm a senior at Howard University, majoring in Computer Science. Originally from Nepal, I’ve been living in Washington, DC, for quite some time now. I’m passionate about exploring how software engineering, machine learning, and computer vision can solve real-world challenges and make a meaningful impact. Outside of academics, I enjoy playing soccer, challenging myself with chess, travelling and spending time with friends—it’s the simple moments that keep me inspired.`,
