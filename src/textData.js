    intro: "Hi, My Name is Manish Niure!",
    description: `I recently graduated from Howard University in May 2025 with a degree in Computer Science. Originally from Nepal, I have been living in Washington, DC for quite some time now.

I am passionate about exploring how software engineering, machine learning, and computer vision can solve real-world challenges and create meaningful impact. During college, I interned at <span class="company-highlight">Meta</span> and <span class="company-highlight">Amazon</span>, where I worked on scalable systems and contributed to tools used by thousands of engineers. I also <a href="https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/9780784486191.060" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="inline-paper-link">co-authored a research paper</a> on video and signal processing for infrastructure monitoring, which was selected for presentation at a national civil engineering conference.

In addition to my academic and industry experience, I have participated in several hackathons and innovation-focused projects, where I enjoyed building creative solutions under pressure and collaborating with others to bring ideas to life.

Outside of tech, I enjoy playing soccer, challenging myself with chess, traveling, and spending time with friends. It is the simple moments that keep me inspired.

I am currently looking for a full-time software engineering role where I can continue learning, contribute to impactful projects, and grow with a collaborative team.`,
