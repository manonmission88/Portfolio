            "The command shell I developed in C supports essential functionalities such as changing directories, handling signals like SIGINT, and providing a clean exit mechanism. Users can navigate the file system effortlessly using the cd command, while signal handling ensures proper termination of processes. Additionally, the shell allows users to exit gracefully using the exit command or Ctrl+D input. These features, along with support for job control and command history, contribute to a user-friendly and efficient command-line experience.",
